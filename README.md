# OMDBApiProject
Interview challenge for Bento

Here is the challenge

Take a look at the OMDb API, here: http://www.omdbapi.com/. It's like an open IMDB with an API, so you can search for movies. Based on their API, create an iOS app that let's me search the OMDb database for movies, using as many of the additional API options as possible. The UI/UX are entirely up to you, and open ended. For example, maybe you give the user an option to hide/show Rotten Tomatoes ratings, or maybe you just build it into the results view in an elegant way. It's however you prefer. To be clear, the goal of the iOS app is to be able to search for movies in a robust way, using the OMDb API.

BONUS Requirements:
The ability to favorite movies.
Once I've favorited the movie, I'd like to be able to see the latest tweets mentioning the movie. The list should continuously update itself.
I'd like to find people who really like the same movies as me. So from the above list, let me see users sorted by those who have tweeted about the movie the most.
Once I have a set of movie results, the ability to sort/filter on them.
